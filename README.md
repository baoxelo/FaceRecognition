# Face Recognition using .NET Core 8
## Abstract
Student attendance is currently receiving a lot of attention from parents because it directly affects academic performance. However, students hardly care about that and find every excuse to truant. Therefore, our team will develop an application to optimize the attendance management process by using .Net Core 8 windows forms app. This application will replace the old attendance process with automatic attendance using facial recognition. The application will receive images from the camera then use algorithms of Emgu CV to process those images and produce results. The results will be displayed on the interface of the app then saved to the SQLite database so they can be edited and viewed later
